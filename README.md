# SVM_Classifiers
Predict cancerous tumors according to some multivariate features using Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression Linear Classifier

Steps:
1.	Load the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset from CSV file. 
2.	Divided the dataset randomly into testing and training with a splitting ration of (70:30). 
3.	Train the algorithms.
4.	Use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model.
5.	Plot the two classes in different colors, along with the decision boundary for each classifier.
